##What is Poker
Poker is a family of card games involving betting and individual play, whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards, some of which remain hidden until the end of the game.

##Is it a game of Luck?
Poker is a game which involves both skill and luck. Now the No. 1 question is why do we play a game which involves luck. This is very much debatable. From my experience I can say that almost everygame involves luck. But each of them has it to their own degree. The minimum can be found in chess and the maximum can be found in Roulette or Just tossing a die to decide the fate. When a chess game is played between two grandmasters luck can sometimes be a factor. A grandmaster might prepare the game expecting the opponent to fall into his gameplan, this might happen or might not happen it completely depends. And in poker the luck will be involved too much if the stakes are less. But when the stakes increases, The luck factor significantly decreases
