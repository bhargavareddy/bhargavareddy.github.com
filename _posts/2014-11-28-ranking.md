##Showdown
Showdown is a situation when the people reveal their cards. This occurs when someone matches a bet or call an all in any situation. The one with the best 5 out of the 7 possible cards will win the hand. (7 means 5 community cards and 2 hole cards)

##Ranking of Poker Hands

###10.High Cards
This is the smallest ranked hand is poker. Which means winning it with high cards.
i.e not pairing any of your cards with the boards. Assume that you have the cards 
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">A</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span>
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">3</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span>
 and your opponent has the hand
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">K</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span>
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">4</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span> 
and the community cards are 
<span class="playingcards clubs" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">Q</span><span class="cardsuits">♣</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">J</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards clubs" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">6</span><span class="cardsuits">♣</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards spades" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">2</span><span class="cardsuits">♠</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards hearts" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">9</span><span class="cardsuits">♥</span></span> 
. This means that no player has any card comman with the board. Which means either of the player can only win with high cards. So the best possible 5 cards of the first player would be
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">A</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span>
<span class="playingcards clubs" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">Q</span><span class="cardsuits">♣</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">J</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards hearts" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">9</span><span class="cardsuits">♥</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards clubs" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">6</span><span class="cardsuits">♣</span></span> 
and the best possible hand of the second player would be
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">K</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span>
<span class="playingcards clubs" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">Q</span><span class="cardsuits">♣</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards diamonds" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">J</span><span class="cardsuits">♦</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards hearts" style="color:red;"><span class="cardranks">9</span><span class="cardsuits">♥</span></span> 
<span class="playingcards clubs" style="color:black;"><span class="cardranks">6</span><span class="cardsuits">♣</span></span> 
. So the one with the highest high card will be the winner in this situation player 1 wins because Ace is the highest card. If the highest card matches then the second highest cards is taken if they are still the same the next one is taken and so on. If the top 5 cards of both the players are the same then this is the situation of a split pot. Which means if there are 100$ in the pot. Then 50$ is given to first and second player each.

####Mathematical Probabilities
Of the 2,598,960 possible five-card combinations, 
![Alt text](/images/blog/number_highcard1.png "Finch UI") 
do not contain any pairs and are neither straights nor flushes. As such, the probability of being dealt "no pair" in a five-card deal is
