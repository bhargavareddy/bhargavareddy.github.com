				<h2 id="what-is-texas-no-limit-holdem-poker">What is Texas No-Limit Holdem Poker</h2>
<p>This variant of poker is played with a deck of 52 cards. Any number of people from 2-10 are good for playing the game. All the players sit round in the circle. They carry a restricted amount of chips into the game. Which will be cashed for money later on. No-Limit means that the amount of chips which we can bet will have no limit on it. We can bet our entire stack. In this variant each player is dealt 2 cards. This is the reason for the word Holdem.</p>

<h2 id="initial-stage-of-the-game">Initial Stage of the Game</h2>
<p>Before the cards are dealt a player, One player is fixed as the dealer, i.e, he is known as the dealer position or Button. The cards are dealt from his left in a clockwise order. The person who first recieved his cards will be known as the small blind (SB). And the one who gets his cards second will be known as the Big Blind (BB). They are called by these names because they start the action. They should keep an involuntary bet pre-decided to start the action. If it is a 1$/2$ game then the small blind keeps 1$ and the big blind keeps 2$. The person next to them needs to match the bet of 2$ to stay in the game. Or else he can raise to atleast twice the Big blind. Or he can simply fold. To keep it fair after the hand is completed the dealer position is shifted to the left so that the blinds are on different persons now. All the money goes to the middle. This is known as the pot and every player in the game competes for the pot. If all the players match the bets, the next round starts</p>

<h2 id="how-the-game-keeps-going">How the game keeps going</h2>
<p>Once the round of betting are completed, three cards are dealt face up which are comman to all the players. Betting again occurs, any finally after calling/raising/folding one more card is dealt face up. Again Betting happens, once done. A final 5th card is dealt face up. Now the betting happens again and finally if someone is not able to call our bet we can take the complete money in the pot. Or if someone calls our bet a showdown occurs in which we reveal the cards. The person uses uses the 5 cards faced up (Community cards) and the 2 cards he is holding to make the best 5 cards. The person with the better rank of cards take the pot.</p>
