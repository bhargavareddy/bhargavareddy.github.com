				<h2 id="what-is-poker">What is Poker</h2>
<p>Poker is a family of card games involving betting and individual play, whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards, some of which remain hidden until the end of the game. In all my tutorials of mine, we will discuss about a particular version which is Texas No-Limit Holdem variant. This version became very popular during the last decade which created many enthusiasts across the world.. </p>

<h2 id="is-it-a-game-of-luck">Is it a game of Luck?</h2>
<p>Poker is a game which involves both skill and luck. Now the No. 1 question is why do we play a game which involves luck. This is very much debatable. From my experience I can say that almost everygame involves luck. But each of them has it to their own degree. The minimum can be found in chess and the maximum can be found in Roulette or Just tossing a die to decide the fate. When a chess game is played between two grandmasters luck can sometimes be a factor. A grandmaster might prepare the game expecting the opponent to fall into his gameplan, this might happen or might not happen it completely depends. And in poker the luck will be involved too much if the stakes are less. But when the stakes increases, The luck factor significantly decreases</p>

<h2 id="skills-required">Skills required</h2>
<p>Poker requires 2 skills. One is Probability Theory and the other is Psychology. Concepts like Game Theory would also be helpful in the later stages of the career. It is highly recommended that you have a basic course of probability theory to start playing poker. Courses can be easily available on youtube or coursera.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-make-money-in-poker">Is it possible to make money in poker?</h2>
<p>I can surely say a yes to the above question. This is same as if you work hard enough will you be the grandmaster in chess, or if you work hard enough will u become a good soccer player. If the answer to the last 2 questions were yes then the answer to the first question will also be a yes. Hard work always will pay off in Poker.</p>
